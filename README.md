# Language Core Values
 
## Introduction
The importance of Core Values is becoming more and more important for deciding a Software Platform or Language. As more and more options become available to us, it's critical that the values of our project align with our platform's values. This tool is subjective and it aims to illistate the values of a given language. I make no claims that these are only values or languages that matter.
